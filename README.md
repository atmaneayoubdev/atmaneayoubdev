Designing intelligence as infrastructure.

## 🔬 Focus

I design and engineer **intelligent systems that reason, retrieve, act, and scale**.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Classical machine learning systems
- Deep learning & computer vision
- Generative AI & large language models
- Agentic orchestration frameworks
- Scalable AI infrastructure

This is not experimentation.

This is production-grade intelligence engineering.

## 🧠 Research & Engineering Themes

### Agentic Systems & Autonomous Workflows

- ReAct, Plan–Execute, Tool-Calling architectures  
- Structured reasoning & intermediate state control  
- Multi-agent coordination  
- Deterministic + LLM hybrid pipelines  
- Guardrails, constraint enforcement, tool validation  
- Long-horizon task decomposition  
- Autonomous decision loops  

> Focus: making LLM systems reliable, inspectable, and controllable.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Hybrid search (BM25 + dense embeddings)  
- Adaptive chunking & semantic segmentation  
- Reranking pipelines  
- Evaluation harnesses (Ragas, DeepEval, custom frameworks)  
- Hallucination mitigation & grounded reasoning  
- Self-correcting retrieval loops  

> Focus: grounding intelligence in structured knowledge.

### Deep Learning & Vision Systems

- Custom CNN / Transformer architectures  
- Detection, segmentation, OCR pipelines  
- GPU optimization & inference acceleration  
- Multilingual vision-language pipelines  
- Real-time deployment constraints  

> Focus: high-throughput, low-latency AI perception systems.

---

### Classical ML & Structured Intelligence

- Tabular modeling & boosting systems  
- Risk modeling & anomaly detection  
- Explainability-first workflows (SHAP, LIME)  
- Drift monitoring & retraining systems  

> Focus: interpretable intelligence in regulated domains.

## 🏗 Systems Architecture Philosophy

AI is not a model.  
AI is a distributed system.

I engineer:

- Kubernetes-native AI services  
- GPU-aware workloads (AWS / Azure / GCP)  
- Observable inference stacks  
- Latency-aware pipelines  
- Failure-resilient deployments  
- Cost-efficient scaling strategies  

Design priorities:

- Determinism where possible  
- LLM flexibility where needed  
- Measurable performance always
