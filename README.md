<h3 align="center">Building production-grade AI systems that reason, retrieve, act, and scale.</h3>

## ⚡ Identity

I engineer intelligence as infrastructure.

Not demos.  
Not notebooks.  
Not wrappers.

I design **end-to-end AI systems** where:

- Models reason with structure  
- Retrieval is measurable  
- Agents execute safely  
- Latency is controlled  
- Infrastructure scales  
- Failure modes are understood  

My work spans classical ML, deep learning, and frontier LLM architectures — unified under one principle:

> Intelligence must be engineered.

# 🧠 Core Domains

## Agentic Architectures (Primary Focus)

- ReAct / Plan-Execute / Tool-calling systems  
- Multi-agent coordination  
- Deterministic + LLM hybrid pipelines  
- Structured intermediate reasoning  
- Constraint-enforced generation  
- Long-horizon task orchestration  
- Guardrails & validation layers  

I build autonomous systems that interact with tools, memory, and structured knowledge — reliably.

---

## Retrieval-Augmented Systems

- Hybrid search (BM25 + dense embeddings)  
- Adaptive semantic chunking  
- Reranking pipelines  
- Self-correcting RAG loops  
- Evaluation-driven iteration  
- Hallucination mitigation through grounding  

Retrieval is not optional.  
It is the backbone of controlled intelligence.

---

## Deep Learning & Vision

- Custom CNN / Transformer pipelines  
- Detection, segmentation, OCR  
- GPU batching & latency tuning  
- Real-time inference APIs  
- Vision-language integration  

Performance and reliability are non-negotiable.

---

## Classical ML & Structured Modeling

- Boosting systems (XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost)  
- Risk & anomaly modeling  
- Explainable ML systems  
- Drift-aware production pipelines  

Not everything needs a transformer.  
Sometimes rigor wins.

# 🏗 System Architecture Mindset

AI is a distributed system problem.

I design:

- Kubernetes-native inference stacks  
- GPU-aware workload orchestration  
- Observable LLM pipelines  
- Latency-budgeted APIs  
- Failure-isolated microservices  
- Cost-optimized inference flows  

Priorities:

- Determinism where possible  
- Flexibility where needed  
- Metrics everywhere
